# Power Consumption Analysis  
## Executive Summary — Statistical Insights

### Context
Energy stakeholders observed noticeable differences in power consumption across zones and seasons but lacked statistical evidence to validate these patterns. As a result, decisions related to capacity planning, operational efficiency, and seasonal readiness were often based on assumptions rather than data.

This project applies statistical analysis to convert raw power consumption data into **clear, defensible insights** that support informed decision-making.

---

### Business Need
Stakeholders required answers to the following questions:
- Are differences in power consumption across zones **statistically significant**?
- Does **winter seasonality** materially increase average power usage?
- Which zones show **higher variability**, indicating potential operational risk or inefficiency?

The objective was to replace intuition-driven decisions with **evidence-based conclusions**.

---

### Vision
The vision of this project was to build a **transparent, reproducible analytical framework** that:
- Uses trusted statistical methods
- Communicates findings in **plain business language**
- Enables confident stakeholder decisions
- Serves as a foundation for future enhancements such as forecasting and anomaly detection

---

### Analytical Approach
- Data cleaning and transformation using **R and tidyverse**
- Exploratory data analysis to assess distributions and seasonal patterns
- Hypothesis testing to evaluate:
  - Zone-level differences in average power consumption
  - Seasonal (winter vs non-winter) consumption effects
- Interpretation focused on **decision impact**, not just statistical significance

---

### Key Outcomes
- Identified **statistically significant differences** in power consumption across zones
- Confirmed **higher winter consumption**, validating seasonal planning assumptions
- Highlighted zones with **greater variability**, flagging areas for deeper operational review
- Delivered **clear, actionable insights** suitable for non-technical stakeholders
